There are 3 thresholds that apply:
1) The minimum amount of time in between two calls - minInterval
2) The maximum amount of time between an attempt and a call - maxWait
3) The default amount of added aggregation time added due to an attempt - aggregationInterval
As well as a minor 'leading' option.

How to determine the next delay:
callDelay = runAt + minInterval - now
waitDelay = firstTriggeredAt + maxWait - now
aggregationDelay = lastTriggeredAt + aggregationInterval - now

actualDelay = max(callDelay, aggregationDelay)
if maxWait then actualDelay = min(actualDelay, waitDelay)

actualDelay = min(callDelay, waitDelay, aggregationDelay)


The case below is equates to:
  minInterval = maxWait = wait
  if !middle then maxWait = infinity, else maxWait = wait



*********

The choice is really for leading and middle

There is never less than `wait` interval between two consecutive calls.

Leading point: previous


leading && middle && wait===5
----L----M----M----M----M----M----c
----Y-yY--yy-Y--Y----y-Y--Y--------



!leading && middle && wait===5
----c----M----M----M----M----M----c
----y-yY--yy-Y--Y----y-Y--Y--------



!leading && !middle && wait===5
----c----------------Tc---------T
----y-yy--yy-y--Y-----y-y--Y-----
